The most comprehensive treatment of ILL is in Gavin Bierman's thesis  \cite{Bierman:1994}.
There one finds the Proof Theory (Chapter 2), i.e, the sequent calculus with cut-eliminaton, natural deduction and
axiomatic versions of ILL. Then (Chapter 3) a term assignment to the natural deduction and to the sequent calculus
versions are presented with $\beta$-reductions and commutative conversions, and strong normalization and confluence
are proved for the resulting calculus. A painstaking analysis of the rules of the labeled calculus leads to the construction
of a categorical model of ILL, a \emph{linear category}, in particular of the exponential part, a main contribution of Bierman and of the Cambridge school of the 1990s with respect to previous models by Seely and Lafont.
Bellin \cite{Bellin:2012} presents a categorical model of co-intuitionistic linear logic based on a dualization of
Bierman \cite{Bierman:1994} construction for ILL..

Benton's work \cite{Benton:1994} on LNL logic, which we read in a TeX report, 
presents the categorical model for Linear-Non-Linear Intuitionistic logic LNL. 
Chapter 2 shows how to obtain a LNL model from a Linear Category and viceversa. 
Versions of the sequent calculus for LNL are considered  and cut-elimination 
is proved for one such version. Then Natural Deduction is given with term
assignment and the categorical interpretation of a fragment of the natural 
deduction system. $\beta$ reductions and commuting conversions are presented.
The present work follows Benton's paper aiming at a (non-trivial) dualization of it.

Bi-intuitionistic logic was introduced by C.Rauszer \cite{Rauszer:1974} (Semi-boolean algebras and 
their applications to intuitionistic logic with dual operations. In \emph{Fundamenta Mathematicae}, 83, pp. 219 249, 1974)
with an algebraic and Kripke semantics \cite{Rauszer:1980} (  An algebraic and Kripke-style approach to a
certain extension of intuitionistic logic, \emph{Dissertationes Mathematicae} 168, 1980)  and  
a Gentzen style sequent calculus \cite{Rauszer:1974a} (A formalization of the propositional calculus of H-B logic. \emph{Studia Logica}, 33(1):23 34, 1974).
Co-intuitionistic logic requires a multiple conclusion system, because of 
the cotensor in the linear case and of contraction right in the non-linear one. 
This raises the problem of the relations between intuitionistic implication 
and disjunction, and, dually, between subtraction and conjunction. 
In the case of the logic FILL that extends ILL with the cotensor (\emph{par}) 
applying Maheara and Dragalin's restriction that only one formula occurs 
in the succedent of the premise of an implication right, yields a calculus 
that does not satisfies cut-elimination, as noticed by Schellinx 
\cite{Schellinx:1991}. Similarly, in the logic BILL (\emph{Bi-Intuitionistic Linear Logic})
requiring that only one formula occurs in the antecedent of the premise of a 
subtraction left yields a system that does not satisfy cut-elimination.

As a simple counterexample, consider the sequent $p \Rightarrow q, r
\rightarrow ((p - q) \wedge r)$ given by Pinto and Uusatlu around 2003
\cite{Pinto-Uustalu:2010}, which is provable with cut but not cut-free
with Dragalin's restrictions.

Hyland and De Paiva introduced a sequent calculus for FILL labeled
with terms
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c}
\AxiomC{$\overline{y}:\Gamma, x:A \vdash t:B, \overline{u}:\Delta$}

where $x: A$ occurs in $t:B$ if and only if there is an ``essential dependency'' of $B$ from $A$. 
The restriction on the $\limp$ I is that $x$ does not occur in the terms  $\overline{u}:\Delta$.
The original term assignment did not guarantee cut-elimination, as noticed by Bierman \cite{Bierman:1996}; 
the assignment to \emph{par left} ($\oplus$ L)  had to be fine tuned, as indicated by Bellin \cite{Bellin:1997}

A detailed presentation of the term calculus for FILL with a full
proof of cut elimination, is in \cite{EadesP:2016}, where the
correctness for a categorical semantics for FILL is also proved.
Another correct formalization of FILL, a sequent calculus with a
relational annotation, was given by Bra\"uner and De Paiva
\cite{BraunerDePaiva:1997}, with a proof of cut-elimination.  The
second author \cite{Bellin:1997} gave a system of proof nets for FILL
which sequentialize in the sequent calculus with term assignment; the
essential fact here is that \emph{$x:A$ occurs in $t:B$ if and only if there
is a ``directed chain'' between $A$ and $B$ in the proof structure.} 
Here cut elimination is proved by reduction to cut-elimination for proof nets.


A system of two-sided proof nets (in the style of natural deduction)
was given by Cockett and Seely \cite{Cockett:1997}.  For
Bi-Intuitionistic Linear Logic, they gave also a system of proof nets,
corresponding to a sequent calculus without annotations and
restrictions that therefore collapses into classical MLL.  Recently,
Clouston, Dawson, GoreÃÅ and Tiu \cite{CloustonDTG:2013} gave an 
annotation-free formalization for BILL, alternative to sequent calculi, 
in the form of deep-inference and display calculi for BILL. This calculus 
enjoys cut-elimination and is relevant to the categorical semantics
bi-intuitionistic linear logic. Annotation-free formalizations of 
Bi-Intuitionistic Logic use the display calculus \cite{Gore:2000}, nested sequents
\cite{GorePT:2008} and deep inference \cite{Postniece:2009}.
 

Tristan Crolard \cite{Crolard:2001,Crolard:2004} made an in-depth
study of Rauszer's logic. In \cite{Crolard:2001} he showed that models
of Rauszer logic (called ``subtractive logic'') based on bi-cartesian
closed categories (with co-exponents) collapse to preorders.  He also
studied models of subtractive logic and showed that its first order
theory is constant-domain logic, thus it is not a conservative
extension of intuitionistic logic.

Crolard \cite{Crolard:2004} develops the type theory for subtractive
logic, extending a system of multiple conclusion classical natural
deduction with a connective of subtraction and then decorating proofs
with a system of annotations of dependencies that allows us to
identify ``constructive proofs'': these are derivations where only the
premise of an implication introduction depends on the discharged
assumption and only the premise of a subtraction elimination depends
on the discharged conclusion. Therefore Crolard's sequent calculus
with annotations is not affected by the counterexamples to
cut-eliminations.

The type theory is Parigot $\lambda\mu$-calculus extended with
operators for sums, products and subtraction, where the operators for
subtraction introduction and elimination are understood as a calculus
of co-routines.  A constructive system of co-routines is then obtained
by imposing restrictions on terms corresponding to the restrictions on
constructive proofs.  

In a series of papers the second author gave a ``pragmatic''
interpretation interpretation of bi-intuitionism, where intuitionistic
and co-intuitionistic logic are interpreted as logics of the acts of
assertion and making a hypothesis, respectively, the interactions
between the two sides depending on negations (see, e.g,
\cite{Bellin:2014} Assertions, hypotheses, conjectures, expectations:
Rough-sets semantics and proof-theory.)  Here the separation between 
intuitionistic and co-intuitionistic logic and their models is given a 
linguistic motivation. Writing  $vdash p$ for the type of assertions that $p$ 
is true and using intuitionistic connectives with the BHK interpretation, one gives 
a ``pragmatic interpretatiion'' of ILL, where an expression $A$ is \emph{justified} 
or \emph{unjustified} (Dalla Pozza and Garola,  
A pragmatic interpretation of intuitionistic propositional logic, Erkenntnis, 43, 1995, pp.81-109.), 
Similarly, writing $\mathcal{H}\;  p$ for the type of hypotheses that $p$ is true,  and  
using co-intuitionistic connectives, one builds a co-intuitionistic language, for which 
an analogue ``pragmatic interpretation'' has been attempted.  Both languages may 
be given a modal interpretattion in S4, with $(\vdash p)^M = \Box p$
and  $(\mathcal{H}\;  p)^M = \diamondsuit p$. Notice that  here thee is a semantic duality between
an assertion t$\vdash p$  and a hypothesis $\mathcal{H}\; \neg p$, as $\Box p$ and 
$\diamondsuit \neg p$ are contradictory, Similarly there is a semantic duality between 
$\mathcal{H}\;  p$ and $\vdash \neg p$, but not between $\assert p$ 
and the hypothesis that $p$ ($\mathcal{H}\, p$). A useful direction of research in the 
proof theory of bi-intuitionism may be the investigation the relations between co-intuitionistic
proofs and intuitionistic refutations. 

It is in this context that a term assignment for co-intuitionistic  logic 
has been developed, starting from Crolard's definition but independently
of the $\lambda\mu$ framework. This calculus was used
here as a term assignment of Dual LNL logic.


To achieve the project outlined in the introduction of putting
together intuitionistic and co-intuitionistic adjoint logic in the
environment of BILL the definition of a suitable syntax for BILL will
play a key role.


% More generally, notice also that co-intuitionistic logic also arises as a logic of refutations of intuitionistic sequents,
% dual to an intuitionistic logic of proofs \cite{Tranchini}.
% However, co-intuitionistic logic could also be regarded as \emph{opposite} to intuitionistic logic, rather than its dual.
